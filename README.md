# CEMAS mobile app (Ionic Framework)
A mobile application that relates to an intelligent emergency response and that brings convenience towards the people. CEMAS application acts as a service that helps users to utilize during emergencies. The idea is to improve what the current process of emergency hotlines is lacking and put those improvements into an application, now named as CEMAS. Unlike the current process, CEMAS includes high-technology features such as a location tracker, emergency contacts, QR code, and panic buttons. These features will help users to reach out to emergency centres with ease as the new process will not consume time and has immediate retrieval of information and locations.
